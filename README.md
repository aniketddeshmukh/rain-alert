# Rain Alert using OpenWeatherMap and Twilio API

This project uses weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API to monitor weather conditions for a given location (specified by latitude and longitude). The system retrieves the hourly weather forecast and checks if rain is predicted in the upcoming hours by evaluating weather condition codes. If rain is expected, the system sends an automated SMS alert to the user via the Twilio API, notifying them to take necessary precautions, such as carrying an umbrella.

Scope: This project can be deployed to the cloud to run at scheduled intervals, providing real-time weather notifications and updates about rain forecasts to users for their preferred locations.
